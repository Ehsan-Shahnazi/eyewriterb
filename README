		Description of EyeWriterB

EyeWriterB is a modification of the open source EyeWriter Project and the open source EyeWriter 2.0 project.
To use the program, first calibrate the eye-tracking software to accurately track the eye. Once this step is complete, pressing the enter/return key will toggle between different modes. During calibration, the program goes fullscreen. This is not currently necessary and can be removed if desired.

NOTE: Make sure to close the program by pressing the esc key. Pressing the close button may leave the program running in the background, which can be difficult to detect especially if the console is not enabled. This is due to a problem with GLUT.

		Using the Source Code

In order to properly build this software, it should be included in the apps directory of openFrameworks 0.061 (using another version will likely not work without some modification). The Code::Blocks IDE is recommended for this project as it was originally created in this IDE. Use of gcc/g++ is also recommended. However, use of gcc optimization is not recommended as the program (specifically the Presage library) does not build correctly for unknown reasons. Setting the build target to debug will allocate a console, which is useful for debugging purposes. Setting it to release will not allocate a console. (This can, of course, be changed through the build target settings).

		Other Misc. Info

This project is only compatible with Windows XP or higher. It will not function on other non-Windows operating systems.

It is worth noting that some characters on the keyboard will not properly appear in the text box. This is due to the fact that these characters are unicode whereas the textbox only supports ASCII characters.

======================================================================

Please not that the source for the Presage library is not contained within this project. Only the compiled version is included. However, the source for this library can be freely downloaded from <http://presage.sourceforge.net/>
